# Clayton Cyre — Portfolio

## Project Overview

This project is a modern frontend developer portfolio built with **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Sass**. It showcases my skills, projects, and experience while emphasizing performance, accessibility, and clean UI architecture. The project uses a hybrid styling approach that combines Tailwind utility classes with structured Sass for scalable, maintainable styling.

The site is optimized for fast load times, responsive layouts, and production deployment.

## Tailwind vs Sass Strategy

This project uses a **hybrid styling architecture** to balance speed and scalability:

* **Tailwind for utility-first layout & spacing** — rapid UI building, consistent design tokens, and responsive behavior.
* **Sass for structure & architecture** — variables, mixins, and partials organize global styles and reusable patterns.
* **Tailwind handles most visual styling** — typography, spacing, flex/grid, responsiveness, and quick iteration.
* **Sass handles custom components** — complex UI pieces, layout systems, and non-utility styling.
* **Design consistency via shared tokens** — Sass variables and Tailwind theme work together to maintain consistent colors, spacing, and typography.
* **Scalable and maintainable** — avoids utility overload while keeping styles modular and readable.
